Variable is a box in memory remebmer that

plain variable = one box

list variable = many boxes

daily_high_temps = [83, 80, 73, 75, 79, 83, 86]
7 boxes being created number 0 to 6

When you referances a list with nothing in [] you are  refering to the set of variables memory location



print(daily_high_temps[0])

list1 = [3.1, 1.2, 5.9]
list2 = [3.0, 2.5]
list3 = list1 + list2
or
list1 += list2
list1.append(Thing to apphend on)

Adds one thing at a time. Apphend is helpful being sometime you dont know how many things you would like to had so you
can do it one thing at a time so you will not have empty spaces or maybe not enough range.



list1[-1] will give you the last thing in the list
